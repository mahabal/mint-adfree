Fork of: [synthead/mint-adfree](https://github.com/synthead/mint-adfree)

Mint.com is pretty great for viewing all of your budgets and finances in one place, but I was pretty annoyed with all of the internal ads and promotional links, so I created a filter list for ad blockers to hide these.

To add this list to uBlock Origin, open uBlock's settings page and click on the "Filter lists" tab.  At the bottom of the page, expand the "Custom" tree and check the "Import..." box.  Then, add this URL to the textarea that appears:

    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mahabal/mint-adfree/master/mint-adfree.txt

Click on the "Apply changes" button that'll appear on the top-right.  You're done!  Mint should now be squeaky clean of promotional junk.  This URL reflects the latest commit to this list, so your ad blocker will auto-update accordingly.

This list can be used on all the other common ad blockers too, but they have their own settings page that I won't get into detail about.  If you don't know about [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en), you might consider switching to it as it's [GPL-licensed](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and is [faster and lighter on resources than other ad blockers](https://github.com/chrisaljoudi/uBlock#performance).

Also, the ads and links on Mint.com are for internal up-sells, so if you never planned to buy any kind of subscription through Mint.com anyway, they're not going to lose any money by you hiding this junk out of view.  This is different than the ads on most websites where they get paid to simply display them in your browser.

Enjoy!
